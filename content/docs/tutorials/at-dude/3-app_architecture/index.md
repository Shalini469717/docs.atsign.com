In this tutorial, we will we'll implement the [MVC+S](https://blog.gskinner.com/archives/2020/09/flutter-state-management-with-mvcs.html) architecture pattern in our app.

We will create the folders that will store our models, views, commands and services.





#### Models

The models are only concerned with storing and manipulation of data our app needs.

In your terminal type:

```
mkdir lib/models
```
The model files will be saved in this folder.

#### Views

The views are the widgets and screen in our application.

In your terminal type:

```
mkdir -p lib/views/widgets
mkdir lib/views/screens
```
The screens and widgets files will be saved in these folders.

#### Commands

The commands are the various application logic.

In your terminal type:

```
mkdir lib/commands
```
The controller files will be saved in this folder.

#### Services

The services fetch data from the network or local storage and return it to the commands.

In your terminal type:

```
mkdir lib/services
```
The services files will be saved in this folder.



#### Conclusion

The commands will call the services to fetch data from the network and then send the fetched data to the model. The views are bound to the model using provider or an alternative. As the models are updated the views will be updated. Alternatively the commands can update the views directly.

In the next step we'll explore this further as we implement onboarding on the atPlatform.
